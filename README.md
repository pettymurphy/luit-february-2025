Demo repository
luit-february-2025

This repository is dedicated to my Python learning journey, starting February 2025.

As I continue developing my skills in Python, this will serve as the central location for:
- All Python scripts I build as part of my class assignments and personal learning
- Experiments and practice projects related to automation, DevOps, and AWS scripting
- Version-controlled development using GitHub

Expect to see beginner to intermediate-level scripts that gradually build up in complexity over time. This will evolve as my skills and confidence in Python improve.

üõ†Ô∏è Topics will include:
- Input handling and conditionals
- Functions and reusable logic
- Scripting for EC2 and AWS automation
- Security tools, CVE checks, and more

Stay tuned as I continue updating this repo with hands-on code, notes, and progress updates.
